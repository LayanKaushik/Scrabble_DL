Issues to overcome:

1. The new word should not count double or triple points once that tile is used before. {Done}
2. Make sure game env checks/validates all the words down and acoss and calculates the points accordingly.
3. The tiles in hand should shuffle only the letters that were used in the previous turn by the same player.
4. Add single letter swap letter option to each turn and turn gets over.
5. The first word should overlap on 7,7 tile.
